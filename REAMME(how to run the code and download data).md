How to run the code and download data :
###

1.You can directly click on open in colab button to run the code on google colab, since when we train the model, we used more than 29 G RAM, so we subscried to colab pro for getting more RAM, you might need more than default RAM to run the code.

2.The first cell of the code is to download data from kaggle, but if you facing problem like file expire(the file might expire three days after we update the link to the file ), you can use this link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/jetakow/home-credit-2024-starter-notebook/notebook  
To the starter Notebook on kaggle and click on Copy&Edit,( you might need log into kaggle as well), after go to kaggle notebook, click on File  -> Open in colab, and copy paste the first cell of code to replace our old first cell to get a new link to the file.

In this way you can download the data from kaggle.
